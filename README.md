# book-study
As I read books, I will be making notes about what I extrapolated from the chap-\
ters I was reading and pushing them here. Feel free to look into it to see how I\
read books, and what I'm learning! (And how much I learn.)

I will also be putting ALL of the notes about books I read here, not just pro-\
gramming ones.
