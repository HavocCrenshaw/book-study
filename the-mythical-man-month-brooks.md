# The Mythical Man Month by Fredrick Brooks Jr.

## PREFACE
Fred worked on one of the first operating systems, OS/360 and one of the first\
high level programming languages. The 60s and early 70s were also a very sparse\
era for software engineering and programming, being a niche field of science,\
and only really having a handful of resources.

## CHAPTER 1 - The Tar Pit
Programming becomes more costly and more complex very quickly, exponentially so.\
It's easy to build a program but it's hard to build a programming project, hard\
to build a programming system, and hardest to build a programming system pro-\
ject. A project being a fully fledged app, dependable, general, usable for many\
sets of data, many machines, for many users. A system being exceptionally ro-\
bust, and dense program. Creating a program project is generally 3 times more\
costly as creating a program. Creating a program system is generally 3 times\
more costly as creating a program. Creating a program system project, therefore,\
is 9 times as costly, but the only truly usable product, and the product that\
should be desired in the undertaking of programming.

Fred is likely a Christian.

Programming is fun for people to do because it is an intellectually invigora-\
ting and is by nature an immensly creative medium, for anything can be calcula-\
ted. Fred also considers programming to be tractable, e.g. obedient to the pro-\
grammer. This is, by programming's very nature, an extremely fitting descrip-\
tion.

But, it is not always fun. Programmers woes, consist of time consuming, tedious\
tasks particularly in debugging, as with every productive hobby or profession.\
You also must be perfect, the computer listens to your program and does ex-\
actly as it is told, and if the programmer makes a mistake, so will the compu-\
ter. And the most dastardly thing, programming requires other people. You do not\
have full control because full control would take all the time of everything\
ever. You need to rely on other people's code to write code, and software is no-\
toriously awful. Poor documentation, incomplete delivery, poor design, now your\
trouble to figure out and fix. And in the other hand, the lack of say about the\
nature of your programming, being told what to make, and the tools you can use\
to make it. However, this view Brooks holds is clearly warped by his strictly\
professional experience in the programming field. Yes, in any professional cap-\
acity this is objectively true, but in hobby this is not. Obvious, but I make\
mention of it anyways.
