# The Mythical Man Month by Fredrick Brooks Jr.

## PREFACE
Fred worked on one of the first operating systems, OS/360 and one of the first\
high level programming languages. The 60s and early 70s were also a very sparse\
era for software engineering and programming, being a niche field of science,\
and only really having a handful of resources.

## CHAPTER 1 - The Tar Pit
Programming becomes more costly and more complex very quickly, exponentially so.\
It's easy to build a program but it's hard to build a programming project, hard\
to build a programming system, and hardest to build a programming system pro-\
ject. A project being a fully fledged app, dependable, general, usable for many\
sets of data, many machines, for many users. A system being exceptionally ro-\
bust, and dense program. Creating a program project is generally 3 times more\
costly as creating a program. Creating a program system is generally 3 times\
more costly as creating a program. Creating a program system project, therefore,\
is 9 times as costly, but the only truly usable product, and the product that\
should be desired in the undertaking of programming.

Fred is likely a Christian.

Programming is fun for people to do because it is an intellectually invigora-\
ting and is by nature an immensly creative medium, for anything can be calcula-\
ted. Fred also considers programming to be tractable, e.g. obedient to the pro-\
grammer. This is, by programming's very nature, an extremely fitting descrip-\
tion.

But, it is not always fun. Programmers woes, consist of time consuming, tedious\
tasks particularly in debugging, as with every productive hobby or profession.\
You also must be perfect, the computer listens to your program and does ex-\
actly as it is told, and if the programmer makes a mistake, so will the compu-\
ter. And the most dastardly thing, programming requires other people. You do not\
have full control because full control would take all the time of everything\
ever. You need to rely on other people's code to write code, and software is no-\
toriously awful. Poor documentation, incomplete delivery, poor design, now your\
trouble to figure out and fix. And in the other hand, the lack of say about the\
nature of your programming, being told what to make, and the tools you can use\
to make it. However, this view Brooks holds is clearly warped by his strictly\
professional experience in the programming field. Yes, in any professional cap-\
acity this is objectively true, but in hobby this is not. Obvious, but I make\
mention of it anyways.

## CHAPTER 2 - The Mythical Man Month
The problem that most software engineering projects have is that humans can't\
estimate the amount of work required to properly do one, and we're a mess and\
can barely keep ourselves and our projects together. Which is true. This is of\
course a reflection of the chaotic world of 60s and 70s software engineering,\
but still rings true today, albeit less severely.

Programmers are far too optimistic, ending up with these ideas that "all will go\
well", e.g. thoughts that you've fixed the last bug and programmers think that\
"it'll only take as long as it should take," which Fred clocks as nonsense,\
which it is.

Fred suggests that the man-month, a unit of measurement at the time for software\
engineering projects, is a fallacious unit of measurement, built on the idea\
that because it worked for partitionable tasks (i.e. farming of sorts) it will\
also work with software engineering, which is an extremely complex field in the\
sense of tasks, some partitionable, some not, and all requiring a lot of com-\
munication, and he suggests that instead of always becoming faster with more\
men, it's true for a moment, but starts to become more timely at a certain\
point. This is because of the cost to communicate.

Fred suggests that a project schedule should be 1/3 planning, 1/6 coding, 1/4\
component and early system tests, 1/4 system tests, all components ready.

He says that software projects need to stop being estimated on a hunch, and at\
the time of his writing, there is no real quantifiable method for estimation in\
professional use. He says, a chef's food is going to take however long it's\ go-\
ing to take, and if the customer gets upset he can eat it raw, and if the chef\
rushes he will create an unjustifiable horror of food. Programmers are similar,\
and this is true with all engineering. Which is why it disturbs him, that pro-\
grammers are not treated in this way, unlike other engineering fields.

The chapter basically boils down to this. Don't be an idiot when estimating, and\
"adding manpower to a late software project makes it later." Men are hard to\
deal with in a software project, they must be trained, briefed, everyone must\
communicate, tasks must be specially partitioned in a specific and sequential\
way.

All of this is very true and I agree in totality.
